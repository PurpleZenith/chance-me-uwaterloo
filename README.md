Looking into some University of Waterloo admissions information for 2020

- Pandas to read in csv and create the dataframes

- Numpy for polynomial fitting, and determining the integral based on dataframe's size

- Tkinter for UI

- Matplotlib for data visualization


### How to use

1. Download the files and run main.py

2. Input information as the program requires (If field is not applicable, put a 0)

3. Close the window and the program will plot

4. The displayed percentage is an approximate "chance" one would get into the program

Note: The dataset (2019 and 2020) is mainly people who have successfully been accepted
